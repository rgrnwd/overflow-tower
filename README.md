Overflow Tower
====================================
There is a stack of water glasses in a form of triangle. Each glass has a configurable capacity (250ml by default).
When a liquid is poured into the top most glass any overflow is evenly distributed between the glasses in the next row. That is, half of the overflow pours into the left glass while the remainder of the overflow pours into the right glass.

## Setup
